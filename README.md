# multiplatform-viewmodel ðŸ—³

Create shared `ViewModel`'s for shared business logic using our `ViewModel` base class.

## Features
- [x] Uses Jetpack `ViewModel` on Android for lifecycled 
- [x] Exposes a `CoroutineScope` to be used in your methods

## Overview of Package
This package has 1 component to it:
A `ViewModel` class you can base your view models on.

## Getting Started

**Add Dependency**

```gradle
commonMain {
    dependencies {
        // ...
        api("com.doublesymmetry:multiplatform-viewmodel:0.0.1")
    }
}
```

**Expose it to iOS native side**
```gradle
ios {
    binaries {
        framework {
            baseName = "shared"
            export(Deps.viewmodel) // required to expose the class to iOS
        }
    }
}
```

## Using it on iOS with a `UIViewController`
When using it on iOS you'll want to make sure that you call `clear()` on your ViewModel on `deinit` to properly kill the `CoroutineScope`
